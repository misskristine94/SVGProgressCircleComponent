# SVGProgressCircleComponent
Progress circle component for your canvas app!

This component has a number of input properties that you can use to customise the SVG without needing to edit the SVG code. Itâ€™s built of only two controls â€“ an image (where the SVG code is) and a label which means that it will not impact the loading time of your app at all. It allows you to visualise progress/utilisation of various activities â€“ total annual leave days taken, total number of tasks completed, or items left in stock â€“ itâ€™s up to you and your use case! 

â—» Value  â€“ this property specifies the â€˜progressâ€™ value. This could be X holidays taken, X tasks completed, X items in stock

â—¼ MaxValue â€“ use this property to set the max value. This could be the total holiday allowance, total number of tasks for the project, total number of items etc.

â—» Percentage â€“ there is already a formula in this property so you donâ€™t need to adjust it! It will calculate the percentage of utilisation â€“ value divided by max value and multiplied by 100.

â—¼ Progress bar border â€“ this property specifies the linecap of the progress bar â€“ if you toggle the value to true, the linecap will be round, if you toggle it off â€“ it will be square.#

â—» BackgroundCircleHexValue â€“ this specifies the colour of the background circle which is set to light gray by default (#9f9f9f). Please only enter the hex value, there is no need to add the hashtag as I have configured this to happen in the background.

â—¼ BackgroundCircleLineThickness â€“ use this to change the width of the background circle â€“ you can make it narrower than the progress bar, or the same width, or any other width you wish! Please enter a numeric value.

â—» ProgressCircleHexValue â€“ same as BackgroundCircleHexValue, this one however relates to the progress bar colour. 

â—¼ ProgressCircleLineThickness â€“ same as BackgroundCircleLineWidth, this one however specifies the width of the progress bar.

â—» PercentageLabelColour â€“ this property specifies the colour of the font of the percentage label.

â—¼ PercentageLabelFontSize â€“ this property specifies the size of the percentage label.

â—» LinealGradient â€“ this is a toggle (Boolean), if you like your visuals to look extra, toggle it to the right to have a nice gradient on your progress bar. If you toggle it to â€˜offâ€™, your progress bar will be of one colour only.

â—¼ LinealGradientHexValue1 and LinealGradientHexValue2 â€“ only use these if your LinealGradient toggle is set to on. This property is responsible for the gradient of your progress bar, please enter hex values without â€˜#â€™.

â—» BoxShadow â€“ this property is another toggle. Set this to â€˜onâ€™ if you like to go the extra mile with your visuals â€“ it will add box shadow to your SVG which will make it look more modern. Set this to off if you want your SVG to be â€˜flatâ€™.
